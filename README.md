# Expressive Air Canvas for Text Recognition and Audio Integration

An interactive **Air Canvas application** that allows users to draw characters in the air using **hand gestures**, recognize the drawn text using a **deep learning model**, and provide optional **audio output** for the recognized text.

This project demonstrates the integration of **computer vision, hand tracking, and neural networks** for touch-free human–computer interaction.
